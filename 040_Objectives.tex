\section{Objectives}
This master thesis consist of two main parts. The first a theoretical background where we study the electronic voting protocol described in \cite{Schoenmakers1999}. In order to understand the protocol, some study in the basic field of cryptography is required. In the second part of the project, we will try to design and implement a web based electronic voting application based on the protocol. Basically this master thesis have the following objectives. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item   Describe the theory behind Shamirs secret sharing and multiparty computation as well as the cryptographical concepts needed to understand it. The aim is to describe the theories clearly and with examples such that one really understand how it works. 
            
    \item   Describe the electronic voting protocol \cite{Schoenmakers1999} and the mathematically justification behind it, again aiming to describe the protocol clearly and with examples to really understands how it works.
    
    \item   Design and implement a secure and scalable web based electronic voting application based on the protocol. Known software design principles will be used to acquire high and reliable software quality.
    The aim is to make the application web based, such that it is easily accessible to a broad audience.
\end{enumerate}
