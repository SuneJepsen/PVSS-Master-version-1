\section{Hypothesis}
Is it possible to create a secure practical usable electronic voting application based on the PVSS protocol. Before we can code an implementation it requires insight into the formal part of the cryptographically parts and then translate this into a proper implementation of the protocol. A goal for the implementation is to experiment with both small and large values and study how the application scales in time.
