\section{Method}
To ensure structure the sections will be contructed based one or more of the following parts.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item General structure 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Informal description
        \item Definition
        \item Example
        \item Proof    
   
    \end{enumerate}
  
    \item Pseudo code
\end{enumerate}

\begin{description}
    \item[General structure] The general rule will be that every section will start informal description of the subject. Here we will give a informal description of why this it is relevant to our rapport. After that a more formal description will come. Their will be parts where the formality will require a more in depth explanation. To avoid disruption we then put this formality last in the section. 
    
    
    \item[Pseudo code]  We will use pseudocode as an informal technique to outline the structure of our algorithms. This technique aims to describe a solution so that it is easy to read for humans.
