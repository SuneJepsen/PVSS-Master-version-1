\section{Method}
To ensure structure the sections will be contructed based one or more of the following 3 methods.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{General structure}  \\
    Informal description\\
    Definition\\
    Example\\
    Proof    
    \item \textbf{Zero-knowledge proof}
    \item \textbf{Pseudo code} 
\end{enumerate}

\parahead{General structure} The general rule will be that every section will start informal description of the subject. Here we will give a informal description of why this it is relevant to our rapport. After that a more formal description will come. Their will be parts where the formality will require a more in depth explanation. To avoid disruption we then put this formality last in the section.    


\parahead{Zero knowledge proof} In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof is a protocol by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without revealing any information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true.


\parahead{Pseudo code} We will use pseudocode as an informal technique to outline the structure of our algorithms. This technique aims to describe a solution so that it is easy to read for humans.
