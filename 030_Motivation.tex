\section{Motivation} There are theoretical papers about how participants can communicate secure. For different reasons there are fewer papers which propose how to implement their theoretical results. It could be interesting to combine the knowledge we gained from our lectures in it-security and software architecture, to describe, design and implement a MPC protocol. In collaboration with our mentor we decided to study and implement the electronic voting solution based on the PVSS protocol describe in \cite{Schoenmakers1999}. In this solution we will have focus on designing a secure and scalable distributed architecture. Using known software design principle from \cite{Bass}, \cite{Baerbak10} and Nygaard, we discuss and reflect on different solutions.
