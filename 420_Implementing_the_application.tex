\subsection(Analyzing the implementation)
We will in this section analyze of implementation. We will analyze the chosen tactics, the code quality and evaluate the security in the implementation. 


\subsubsection(Security analyze)


\begin{itemize}
    \item The chosen strategy for random generator is based on Math.Random.. is this secure?, is web based randomness is secure at all?
    \item What is the consequence of a man-in-the-middel attack
    \item What is the consequence of having the "clients" computing the verification instead of the bulletinboard 
\end{itemize}
