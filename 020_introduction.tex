\section{Introduction}
\parahead{A MPC protocol}  allows several parties to compute some function on some private inputs, in such a way that they learn the result but not the inputs from the other players.  The challenge with MPC protocol is that it assumes that everyone is honest and sends correct data. \\


\parahead{In the Public verifiable secret sharing (PVSS protocol)} there is mechanisms to verify the correctness of the transmitted data.\\\\

\parahead{Secret sharing protocol} allows several parties to compute some function on some private inputs, in such a way that they learn the result but not the inputs from the other parties. When more than two parties want to share something secret, then they need some tools “Protocols” to make it possible. In this section we will look at secret sharing. We will look at sharing and reconstructing the secret from the shares - and how this can technically be possible.
