A user applies for voting for a given election and a registration authority will either accept or reject his application.  If the user is accepted then he should be able to logon a voting page and cast his vote.  When all the registered voters have casted their votes or a deadline is reached, the system should tally the votes and then publish the result on a webpage. of cause only valid votes are included in the tallying process. The tally process should be handled by registered talliers. During this process none of the talliers should be able relate a  vote to a voter. Nor should a tally be able to manipulate the tallying process by either adding, removing or alter votes. Each tally should be hold accountable for his participant in the tallying process. If the tally is discovered in cheating he is replaced by another tally during the tallying process. This replacement should not have influence on the result nor should it required re-election.
