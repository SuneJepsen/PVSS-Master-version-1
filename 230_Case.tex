If the user is accepted then he should be able to logon a voting page and cast his vote.  When all the registered voters have casted their votes or a deadline is reached, the system should tally the votes and then publish the result on a webpage. of cause only valid votes are included in the talliering process. The tally process should be handled by registered talliers. During this process none of the talliers should be able relate a  vote to a voter. Nor should a tallier be able to manipulate the talliering process by either adding, removing or alter votes. Each tallier should be hold accountable for his participant in the talliering process.
